# Import Data

```{R, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
rawGraduate <- read_excel("109cityu.xls")
rawWage <- read_excel("workplaceWageCity.xlsx")
rawWorkforce <- read_excel("cityWorkforce.xlsx")
```

```{R}
CITY <- cbind(rawWage["...1"], rawWage["109"], rawWage["108"], rawWage["107"], rawGraduate$...10[5:24])
colnames(CITY) <- c("city", "wage2020", "wage2019", "wage2018", "graduate2020")
CITY$graduate2020 <- as.numeric(CITY$graduate2020)
direct <- seq(0, 0, length.out = 20)
direct[1:6] <- 1
CITY <- cbind(CITY, direct)
rm(direct)
```

## Data manipulation 

```{R, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
workforceTranspose <- function(name, start, end) {
    year <- 2010
    for(n in start:end){
        CITY <- cbind(CITY, transpose(rawWorkforce[n, 4:23]))
        colnames(CITY)[ncol(CITY)] <- paste(name, year, sep = "_")
        CITY[ncol(CITY)] <- as.numeric(unlist(CITY[ncol(CITY)]))
        year <- year + 1
    }
    return(CITY)
}
```

```{R}
CITY <- workforceTranspose("workforceCollege", 3, 14)
CITY <- workforceTranspose("workforceYoung", 16, 27)
CITY <- workforceTranspose("workforceMiddle", 29, 40)
CITY <- workforceTranspose("workforceOld", 42, 53)
CITY <- workforceTranspose("workforceRetired", 55, 66)
summary(CITY)
```

# SLR with college graduates number
```{R, results='hold'}
slr <- lm(CITY$wage2020 ~ CITY$graduate2020, )
summary(slr)
#stargazer(slr)
```

```{R}
plot(CITY$graduate2020, CITY$wage2020, main="2020 City Data", xlab="No. of Graduate", ylab="Average yearly wage ($10,000)")
text(CITY$graduate2020[c(8,19)], CITY$wage2020[c(8,19)], labels = c("Hsinchu County", "Hsinchu City"), cex = 0.6, pos = 4)
abline(slr)
```

# SLR with college worker share
```{R, results='hold'}
slr2 <- lm(CITY$wage2020 ~ CITY$workforceCollege_2020, )
summary(slr2)
#stargazer(slr2)
```

```{R}
plot(CITY$workforceCollege_2020, CITY$wage2020, main="2020 City Data", xlab="Share of college worker (%)", ylab="Average yearly wage ($10,000)")
text(CITY$workforceCollege_2020[c(8,19)], CITY$wage2020[c(8,19)], labels = c("Hsinchu County", "Hsinchu City"), cex = 0.6, pos = 4)
abline(slr2)
```

## Heteroskedaticity

### Test
We use the White Test for heteroskedaticity by specifying a formula with interaction term and sqaure term to the BP Test.
```{R}
bptest(slr2, ~ CITY$workforceCollege_2020 + I(CITY$workforceCollege_2020^2))
```
Heteroskedaticity doesn't seem present.

### Robust

# MLR
```{R, results='hold'}
mlr <- lm(CITY$wage2020 ~ CITY$workforceCollege_2020 + CITY$direct + CITY$wage2018, )
summary(mlr)
#stargazer(mlr)
```

## Heteroskedaticity

### Test
We use the White Test for heteroskedaticity by specifying a formula with interaction term and sqaure term to the BP Test.
```{R}
bptest(mlr, ~ CITY$workforceCollege_2020 + CITY$workforceCollege_2020 + CITY$direct + CITY$wage2018 + I(CITY$workforceCollege_2020^2) + I(CITY$wage2018^2) + I(CITY$workforceCollege_2020*CITY$wage2018))
```
Heteroskedaticity doesn't seem present.

### Robust

## Instrumental variable: workforce age structure
```{R}
IVmlr <- ivreg(CITY$wage2020 ~ CITY$workforceCollege_2020 + CITY$direct + CITY$wage2018 | CITY$workforceMiddle_2010 + CITY$workforceOld_2010)
summary(IVmlr)
```

# First difference panel data

## Construct difference term
```{R}
CITY <- mutate(CITY, wageDiff1 = wage2020-wage2019, 
wageDiff2 = wage2019-wage2018, 
workforceCollegeDiff1 = workforceCollege_2020 - workforceCollege_2019, 
workforceCollegeDiff2 = workforceCollege_2019 - workforceCollege_2018)
```
```{R, eval = FALSE}
CITY$wageDiff1 <- c(CITY$wageDiff1, CITY$wageDiff2)
CITY$workforceCollegeDiff1 <- c(CITY$workforceCollegeDiff1, CITY$workforceCollegeDiff2) 
```
